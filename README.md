# ML-MODEL-TRANSACTION-PRICE
In this Project, we have creayed a ML model which can predict the land transaction prices when we required data.we built five pipelines of lasso regressor,Ridge regressor,Elastic net,Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor.Finally we tested their losses on the data with metrics through which we concluded that Random Forest model worked well this time.
